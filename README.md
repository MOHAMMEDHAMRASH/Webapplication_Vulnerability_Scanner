# Webapplication_Vulnerability_Scanner

This Python script provides a basic security vulnerability scanner that tests for common vulnerabilities: SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python vulnerability_scanner.py
   ```

4. Enter the target URL when prompted.

## Vulnerabilities Tested

### SQL Injection

The `test_sql_injection` function tests for SQL Injection vulnerabilities by sending specific payloads as query parameters in the URL.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

The `test_xss` function tests for XSS vulnerabilities by injecting a simple script into the URL as a query parameter.

## Example

```python
# Target URL to test
target_url = input('Enter the URL you want to check for vulnerabilities: ')

# Call the testing functions
test_sql_injection(target_url)
test_xss(target_url)
```

## Disclaimer

This script is a simplified demonstration for educational purposes and is not a comprehensive security testing tool. Real-world security testing requires more thorough and structured approaches, often involving specialized tools and expertise. Use this script responsibly and only on systems for which you have permission to perform security testing.
